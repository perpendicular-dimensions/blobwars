Entering the alien base, Bob found it strangely deserted. His attention was drawn
to a large video monitor showing a map of his homeworld. Several places on the map
had been marked that Bob recognised but there were two that he was unfamiliar with.
But before he could investigate further a sound interrupted him...

Leaving the smouldering remains of the Bio Tanks behind him, Bob turned his attention
again to the screen. He discovered that the map showed the location of two ancient
tombs and made a reference to "Powerful Crystals". Bob knew not of the tombs or the
Crystals, but what he did know is that he would need to get there before the aliens did.

Exploring the base Bob quickly discovered the location of the third ancient tomb. But
his next discovery turned his stomach. The aliens' experimentation on his fellow Blobs
had reached a new low, as he looked into the feeding pool of the laser gun armed
tentacled freak. Bob decided immediately to kill it. And take the aqua lung too.

The creature died filling the feeding pool with even more blood than before. Bob climbed
out of the water and assessed the situation. He now not only had the location of the
third ancient tomb but also an aqua lung. It would enable him to reach areas and his
friends that before he could not. Bob wasted no time in continuing his mission.

Bob knew what he had to do as he entered the alien base - This was where all his fellow
Blobs had been converted into their evil forms. His primary objective was to destroy
the base, discover the location of the final tomb and ensure no other Blobs were
mutated. He halted as the BioMech Jetpack Blob adjusted its course to attack him...

Despite the BioMech having a shifting frequency shield generator, Bob had defeated it
and left its smouldering body twitching on the floor. His new jetpack would no doubt
come in very useful in his further quest. He was certain that now he would be able to
fully complete his mission.

Bob stood motionless in the tomb as he watched the Crystal teleport away. Laughter
made him turn around to see Galdov little more than a few feet away. "Too
late, Bob! The Crystal is mine!" the evil Metal Blob laughed. Bob fired his pistol, but the
bullet merely caused what Bob discovered to be a hologram to shimmer.

"I'll be back for the others, Bob. Mark my words." Galdov's image disappeared leaving Bob
alone in the tomb. He activated his teleporter and vowed to track Galdov to the alien
headquarters and retrieve the Crystal. Bob was worried though. There seemed to be something
different about this Crystal compared to the others he held.

"At last!" Galdov's voice boomed across the chamber, "I'm disappointed, I thought you
would be here sooner." The evil Metal Blob moved in close to Bob and looked down at
him. "I should thank you, Bob. I learned long ago that one should keep their
friends close and their enemies closer!"

"By having my troops follow your movements I discovered not only the entrances to many
of the tombs, but also of the exact locations of the Crystals." Bob glared back at
Galdov as the alien leader laughed heartily. "Aw, don't pull that face! If only you
had the power of this Crystal in your hands..."

"I have been having such fun with it, and I do believe that I have barely even begun to
discover the secrets that it holds. But back to the point at hand; I believe you came
here to kill me, did you not? I warn you, little Blob that this is by far the most
interesting Crystal of the lot..."

"... and it has given me AWESOME POWERS!!!" Galdov sprang high into the air and was suddenly
bathed in energy eminating from the Reality Crystal. As the column of cyan hues curled and
twisted in the air, Bob braced himself for the unknown battle that he was about to face.

Galdov glowered at Bob, "Foolish creature, your victory here is but an empty one. I still
hold the most powerful Crystal your race failed to defend. Despite your pathetic efforts
you cannot stop us! You have lost, Bob! LOST!!!". Galdov activated his teleporter and
escaped the base. Bob knew he was right and would have to pursue Galdov to get the 
Crystal back at all costs.

But there was much work still to be done. Before Bob could chase after Galdov he would
need to finish his first primary mission and rescue all his fellow Blobs that he knew
were still scared and hiding around the world. Once he had done this and completed all
the other objectives he could confront Galdov.

Galdov has escaped to the orbital space station the aliens had constructed around the
Blobs' homeworld. Bob knew that his own teleporter would not reach the base, but if
he could locate some power sources for the Blob's experimental Long Range Teleporter
System (L.R.T.S.) then he would be able to pursue and defeat Galdov once and for all.

Bob's mission was over. He had managed to rescue all his fellow soldiers and safely
return them home. There was much rejoicing as Bob's shimmering image began to appear
back at the Blobs' base of operations. Now they would be able to attempt to battle
the aliens once more.

But this was just a small fraction of what Bob would have to achieve in order to see
off the aliens. He would need to battle the evil alien leader, Galdov; Destroy alien
bases and their inhabitances; And finally he would need to discover the reason for
the life time of war. Why had the aliens invaded his planet?

To see the true ending of Blob Wars: Metal Blob Solid you will need to play again on 
Normal or Hard, where you will discover all the answers to your questions and also
experience a much more indepth and challenging gaming experience. Bob's destiny is
much more complex than just rescuing MIAs...

"If there is only one thing to admire in your race, it is that you are persistent." said
the BioMech leader as Bob entered the Space Station control room.
Galdov slowly turned around from where he was staring down at the Blobs' homeworld. Bob
stood where he was and looked up at the evil machine. For long moments neither of them did
anything except stand and look at one another.

"You cannot win." said Galdov flatly, as though very plainly stating a fact. Bob said nothing
and continued to stare with defiance at his adversary. Finally Galdov moved slowly forward
and came to rest a short way from Bob. And with the same cool resolution simply said, "Let's
get this over with...".

Bob's weaponry finally found its mark and with a large snapping sound, Galdov's shield
collapsed. The next bullet penetrated the evil machine's light armour before ripping its
way through hundreds of delicate pieces of circuitry. With a cry of pain and fury Galdov
realised his underestimated opponent was the victor.

At the same time as Galdov spun away across the Command Bridge's floor, the dynamite Bob
had planted around the station began to go off. Evacuation warnings began sounding all
around the two adversaries, but for Galdov the future had already been decided.

With one last look at the malfunctioning Metal Blob, Bob gathered up the Reality Crystal and
activated his Long Range Teleport System. He was sure that despite everything being beyond
the evil machine's control Galdov had given Bob one last stare of contempt before he 
vanished from the Space Station.

Arriving back in the grasslands of his home, Bob was greeted by raptous applause and cheers
from fellow soldiers and the MIAs he had managed to save. The cheers paused for a few
brief seconds as a bright light turned all their attentions to the sky. Then, as they
saw the alien station explode in a shower of coloured particles, the cheers continued even louder.

Bob had done much more that day than just defeating an alien leader and saving his fellow
Blobs. He had given the entire race hope; Hope that after a lifetime of war the Blobs could
vanquish the alien host and return to a world of peace and without destruction. Bob had
showed them how and with his leadership they could achieve that goal.

However even without their leader, the aliens were still great in number and had bases
and control points all around their world. Even now the aliens would be regrouping and
refocusing their efforts on the conquest of the Blobs and the retrevial of the Crystals
and the mysteries they contained.

Whilst the celebration continued there was little doubt in Bob's mind that this war
was far from over. But from what he was seeing and hearing right now he was very certain
of one thing: There were still many battles to be fought and when the next one came 
the aliens would be ready...
