    Entering the alien base, Bob found it strangely deserted. His attention was drawn to a large video
    monitor showing a map of his homeworld. Several places on the map had been marked that Bob recognised
    but there were two that he was unfamiliar with. But before he could investigate further a sound interrupted
    him...

    Leaving the smouldering remains of the Bio Tanks behind him, Bob turned his attention again to the
    screen. He discovered that the map showed the location of two ancient tombs and made a reference to
    "Powerful Crystals". Bob knew not of the tombs or the Crystals, but what he did know is that he would
    need to get there before the aliens did.

    Exploring the base Bob quickly discovered the location of the third ancient tomb. But his next discovery
    turned his stomach. The aliens' experimentation on his fellow Blobs had reached a new low, as he looked
    into the feeding pool of the laser gun armed tentacled freak. Bob decided immediately to kill it.
    And take the aqua lung too.

    The creature died filling the feeding pool with even more blood than before. Bob climbed out of the
    water and assessed the situation. He now not only had the location of the third ancient tomb but also
    an aqua lung. It would enable him to reach areas and his friends that before he could not. Bob wasted
    no time in continuing his mission.

    Bob knew what he had to do as he entered the alien base - This was where all his fellow Blobs had
    been converted into their evil forms. His primary objective was to destroy the base, discover the
    location of the final tomb and ensure no other Blobs were mutated. He halted as the BioMech Jetpack
    Blob adjusted its course to attack him...

    Despite the BioMech having a shifting frequency shield generator, Bob had defeated it and left its
    smouldering body twitching on the floor. His new jetpack would no doubt come in very useful in his
    further quest. He was certain that now he would be able to fully complete his mission.

    Bob stood motionless in the tomb as he watched the Crystal teleport away. Laughter made him turn around
    to see Galdov little more than a few feet away. "Too late, Bob! The Crystal is mine!" the evil Metal
    Blob laughed. Bob fired his pistol, but the bullet merely caused what Bob discovered to be a hologram
    to shimmer.

    "I'll be back for the others, Bob. Mark my words." Galdov's image disappeared leaving Bob alone in
    the tomb. He activated his teleporter and vowed to track Galdov to the alien headquarters and retrieve
    the Crystal. Bob was worried though. There seemed to be something different about this Crystal compared
    to the others he held.

    "At last!" Galdov's voice boomed across the chamber, "I'm disappointed, I thought you would be here
    sooner." The evil Metal Blob moved in close to Bob and looked down at him. "I should thank you, Bob.
    I learned long ago that one should keep their friends close and their enemies closer!"

    "By having my troops follow your movements I discovered not only the entrances to many of the tombs,
    but also of the exact locations of the Crystals." Bob glared back at Galdov as the alien leader laughed
    heartily. "Aw, don't pull that face! If only you had the power of this Crystal in your hands..."

    "I have been having such fun with it, and I do believe that I have barely even begun to discover the
    secrets that it holds. But back to the point at hand; I believe you came here to kill me, did you
    not? I warn you, little Blob that this is by far the most interesting Crystal of the lot..."

    "... and it has given me AWESOME POWERS!!!" Galdov sprang high into the air and was suddenly bathed
    in energy eminating from the Reality Crystal. As the column of cyan hues curled and twisted in the
    air, Bob braced himself for the unknown battle that he was about to face.

    Galdov glowered at Bob, "Foolish creature, your victory here is but an empty one. I still hold the
    most powerful Crystal your race failed to defend. Despite your pathetic efforts you cannot stop us!
    You have lost, Bob! LOST!!!". Galdov activated his teleporter and escaped the base. Bob knew he was
    right and would have to pursue Galdov to get the Crystal back at all costs.
- duration: 20

    But there was much work still to be done. Before Bob could chase after Galdov he would need to finish
    his first primary mission and rescue all his fellow Blobs that he knew were still scared and hiding
    around the world. Once he had done this and completed all the other objectives he could confront Galdov.

    Galdov has escaped to the orbital space station the aliens had constructed around the Blobs' homeworld.
    Bob knew that his own teleporter would not reach the base, but if he could locate some power sources
    for the Blob's experimental Long Range Teleporter System (L.R.T.S.) then he would be able to pursue
    and defeat Galdov once and for all.

    Bob's mission was over. He had managed to rescue all his fellow soldiers and safely return them home.
    There was much rejoicing as Bob's shimmering image began to appear back at the Blobs' base of operations.
    Now they would be able to attempt to battle the aliens once more.

    But this was just a small fraction of what Bob would have to achieve in order to see off the aliens.
    He would need to battle the evil alien leader, Galdov; Destroy alien bases and their inhabitances;
    And finally he would need to discover the reason for the life time of war. Why had the aliens invaded
    his planet?

    To see the true ending of Blob Wars: Metal Blob Solid you will need to play again on Normal or Hard,
    where you will discover all the answers to your questions and also experience a much more indepth
    and challenging gaming experience. Bob's destiny is much more complex than just rescuing MIAs...

    "If there is only one thing to admire in your race, it is that you are persistent." said the BioMech
    leader as Bob entered the Space Station control room. Galdov slowly turned around from where he was
    staring down at the Blobs' homeworld. Bob stood where he was and looked up at the evil machine. For
    long moments neither of them did anything except stand and look at one another.

    "You cannot win." said Galdov flatly, as though very plainly stating a fact. Bob said nothing and
    continued to stare with defiance at his adversary. Finally Galdov moved slowly forward and came to
    rest a short way from Bob. And with the same cool resolution simply said, "Let's get this over with...".

    Bob's weaponry finally found its mark and with a large snapping sound, Galdov's shield collapsed.
    The next bullet penetrated the evil machine's light armour before ripping its way through hundreds
    of delicate pieces of circuitry. With a cry of pain and fury Galdov realised his underestimated opponent
    was the victor.

    At the same time as Galdov spun away across the Command Bridge's floor, the dynamite Bob had planted
    around the station began to go off. Evacuation warnings began sounding all around the two adversaries,
    but for Galdov the future had already been decided.
- duration: 23

    With one last look at the malfunctioning Metal Blob, Bob gathered up the Reality Crystal and activated
    his Long Range Teleport System. He was sure that despite everything being beyond the evil machine's
    control Galdov had given Bob one last stare of contempt before he vanished from the Space Station.

    Arriving back in the grasslands of his home, Bob was greeted by raptous applause and cheers from fellow
    soldiers and the MIAs he had managed to save. The cheers paused for a few brief seconds as a bright
    light turned all their attentions to the sky. Then, as they saw the alien station explode in a shower
    of coloured particles, the cheers continued even louder.

    Bob had done much more that day than just defeating an alien leader and saving his fellow Blobs. He
    had given the entire race hope; Hope that after a lifetime of war the Blobs could vanquish the alien
    host and return to a world of peace and without destruction. Bob had showed them how and with his
    leadership they could achieve that goal.

    However even without their leader, the aliens were still great in number and had bases and control
    points all around their world. Even now the aliens would be regrouping and refocusing their efforts
    on the conquest of the Blobs and the retrevial of the Crystals and the mysteries they contained.
- duration: 23

    Whilst the celebration continued there was little doubt in Bob's mind that this war was far from over.
    But from what he was seeing and hearing right now he was very certain of one thing: There were still
    many battles to be fought and when the next one came the aliens would be ready...

    ... and so would the Blobs.
