CHANGE LOG

Version 1.01

* Fixed Uncharted Cavern and a bunch of other levels where a segfault or potential segfault could
  occur on load. This was caused by these levels having more than 300 lines of level data (update to
  the map editor may have been writing too many lines upon save due to an array overflow).
