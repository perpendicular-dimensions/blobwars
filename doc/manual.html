<A NAME="introduction"></A>
<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>Blob Wars : Metal Blob Solid is a platform game, not unlike those found on the Amiga and SNES. The object of the
game is to take on the role of solider Blob, Bob, and play through the various levels and attempt to rescue as
many MIA (Missing In Action) Blobs as possible. This is not quite as straight forward as it sounds, since the MIAs
will often be not directly reachable and will require some extra thought. Bob also has to contend with environmental
hazards, alien invaders and assimilated Blobs.</P>

<A NAME="requirements"></A>
<H4>Requirements</H4>
<P>Blob Wars requires the following,</P>

Color Depth       : 16 bit or greater
Harddrive         : 38MBs
Controls          : Keyboard (or Joypad)
</PRE>

<P>Most Linux users will find that the required SDL libraries came with their system and are probably already
installed. If not, click the name of the library above to go to the relevant homepage.</P>

<A NAME="installation"></A>
<H4>Installation</H4>
<P>Blob Wars : Metal Blob Solid can be installed in two different ways. The first (and easiest) is by using
a binary RPM package. The second involves building the game. It is recommended that you install via an RPM
if you are able to. You will require the libraries listed in the Requirements section whichever method you
choose. For installation from source you will also require the development packages for those libraries
listed.</P>

<P><B>Installation from RPM Package</B></P>
<P>To install from RPM simply use your preferred method of installation (eg - via a GUI such as KPackage
or via a terminal). If you wish to install via a terminal you can use the do so by typing
the following (remember to change the filename to match the name of the package you are installing),</P>

<P CLASS="terminal">rpm -U blobwars-x.x-x.i586.rpm</P>

<P>Provided you have all the required libraries installed the game should install without problems.</P>

<P><B>Installation from source</B></P>
<P>If you choose this method you will need to build the game from source. This will require all the appropriate
development libraries (see Requirements) and some knowledge of building an application using the source code.
Open a terminal and use the following commands to extract, compile and install the game (again remember to change the
filename to match the name of the download),</P>

<P CLASS="terminal">
tar xzf blobwars-x.x-x.tar.gz<BR>
cd blobwars-x.x-x<BR>
make<BR>
make install<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">*</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><I>* - You will have to be root in order to perform this step.</I></P>

<P>Notes</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Default installation target is /usr/games for the binary and usr/share/games for the data</LI>
	<LI>Music and Font data are extracted to /tmp and loaded from there. SDL currently does not support loading
	music directly from memory. Also segmentation faults occurred when loading fonts from memory. These are
	only minor issues and should not affect the game in any way.</LI>
	<LI>Menu items are added for Gnome and KDE desktops into Games and Games/Arcade respectively.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Medal Service</B></P>
<P>
This step is optional. If you wish to make use of the Medal Service (in-game achievements), you will need to create
and install a Medal Key. This is a simple process, which should not take more than a few minutes. To create the Medal
Key, visit:

<A NAME="story"></A>
<H4>The Story</H4>

<P>Bob is a solider in the Blob Army. Many years ago the Blobs' Homeworld was invaded by a race of symbiotic
cybernetic organisms. Since then the Blobs have faced a lifetime of war. Recently the Blob Army has decided to
fall back, regroup and change their offensive strategy. But some soliders did not regroup. They were marked as
Missing In Action and left. However one solider was not happy with this arrangement.</P>
<P>Bob made it his mission to go out and <I>"Bring Our Boys Home"</I>. There had been enough loss of life already and
Bob wanted to bring back as many soliders as possible, even if he died trying.</P>
<P>But one thing puzzled him. The aliens could have wiped out their planet in just a matter of months. But
they hadn't. The aliens could have taken all the resources they wanted and left. But they hadn't. What were
they really after? And why?</P>

<H4>How to Play</H4>
<P>Playing Blob Wars : Metal Blob Solid is very straight forward. If you have ever played games such as
Super Mario Brothers then you will get the hang of the game very quickly. Blob Wars : Metal Blob Solid has
game play elements more closely related to The New Zealand Story though, since you have weapons with which
to attack and can do other things such as swim.</P>
<P>You can move Bob around the game world by using the arrow keys (see Controls) and using left CTRL to fire
your current weapon. Due to the nature of the game, there are no ammunition restrictions so you can use
your current weapon as much as you want. Also note that it is not possible to manually change weapons. To
change your weapon you must pick up a weapon icon.</P>
<P>Remember to keep an eye on your health (the red squares at the top of the screen). When you take damage
you will lose a red square (or more depending on how you were damaged!). Bob is killed when all his health
is depleted. At this point the game ends and you fail the mission. If you have reached a checkpoint before
this time you will be given the option to continue (see Checkpoints). You get health back by picking up
Cherries (a Blob's staple diet). One Cherry restores on unit of health so grab them whenever you see them.</P>
<P>When swimming you have a limited amount of oxygen. Your current oxygen is represented by a set of blue
squares to the right of your health. When you are underwater these squares are slowly removed. Once they
run out your health will quickly begin to deplete, so don't stay underwater too long! You get oxygen back
when you are out of the water.</P>
<P>Blob Wars : Metal Blob Solid is divded into various missions, each with their own objectives. Depending
on the level of difficulty you play on the number of objectives will change. For all difficulty levels you
will be required to rescue a certain amount of MIAs. Other difficulty levels will have other objectives
that you will be required to complete. See "Completing Missions" for more information.</P>

<A NAME="mias"></A>
<H4>Rescuing MIAs</H4>

<P><IMG SRC="scaredMIA.gif" TITLE="MIA" ALIGN="LEFT">
To rescue an MIA you simply walk into them. They will then be automatically teleported back home.
This however is not always easy. Since you can only rescue an MIA by walking into them, you must first
<I>be able</I> to do so. Some MIAs will be in high places, others behind doors. You may have to over come
certain obstacles and other factors before you can rescue them.</P>

<A NAME="objectives"></A>
<H4>Objectives</H4>
<P>As well as rescuing MIAs, some missions have other objectives. These can vary from finding objects, to
defeating a certain enemies or number of enemies. Before a mission can be cleared you must first complete
all the required objectives. Special objectives, such as Exiting a Mission, can only be achieved once all
the other required objectives are completed. If that sounds complicated, don't worry, you'll get the idea!
See "Completing Missions" for more information.</P>

<P>You can see a list of objectives by pressing "P" to pause the game. This will also show each objective's
completion status, including how much more is needed to be done.</P>

<A NAME="missions"></A>
<H4>Completing Missions</H4>
<P>In order to complete a mission in Blob Wars : Metal Blob Solid, you will need to complete all the
required objectives. For most missions this will involve rescuing a certain number of MIAs. The required
objectives change depending on which level of difficulty you are playing on.</P>
<P>The mission "Grasslands" requires you to rescue 5 MIAs. If you have set the difficulty to Normal or above
then you will also be required to find a Transmitter.</P>

<P>During the course of the mission you will receive checkpoints. These checkpoints allow you continue
if you are killed during the mission. See below for more information.</P>

<A NAME="checkpoints"></A>
<H4>Checkpoints</H4>
<P>Upon completing objectives you will be awared a checkpoint. A checkpoint allows you to restart the mission
from a certain point if you are killed during play. When you are presented with the Game Over text, pressing
space will bring up the continue options. You may either restart from the last checkpoint or return to the
title screen. If you did not reach a checkpoint when you are killed you will simply be taken back to the
title screen without prompting.</P>

<P>Checkpoints are also awarded for rescuing half the number of required MIAs, all the required MIAs and the
total MIAs on a mission. So, if you are required to rescue 12 MIAs you will receive a checkpoint after
rescuing 6 and another for rescuing all 12.</P>

<P>When restarting you will restart from the location you were at when the checkpoint was awarded (or the
last place where you were on solid ground). You will
restart with half your full health and everything you did before you were killed will be the way it was (so,
if you saved an MIA after a checkpoint and were killed before receiving another you won't have to rescue
the MIA again). Checkpoints can only be used a maximum of 3 times. Everytime you receive a checkpoint notice
you will be allowed to continue a further 3 times. The number of continues remaining is noted in brackets
next to the Continue option.</P>

<P>Note that due to the nature of the game it is not possible to continue on Boss missions.</P>

<A NAME="gameover"></A>
<H4>Game Over</H4>
<P>The game ends when Bob is killed during a mission (his health is reduced to 0). At this point you will be
presented with a Game Over message. If you have managed to receive a check point (from completing objectives)
you will be given the option to return to this check point or quit to the title screen. Otherwise you
will be taken back to the title screen.</P>

<A NAME="hub"></A>
<H4>Hub</H4>
<P>The Hub is the place you will spend time between missions. The Hub allows you to select which mission you
will next undertake and also give you information relating to the missions you have just done, which MIAs
you have currently rescued and some overall game statistics.</P>

<P>The hub can be effectively divided into three different areas - The Map, the Destination Bar and the
Action Bar</P>

<P>The main screen of the Hub is the map. The map will show various locations that can be visited (represented
by animated red shapes). Placing the mouse cursor over these locations will show their name just above the
cursor. To select a destination left click on the location. The Destination Bar will change to reflect the
name destination you have choosen. Right clicking on the location will display statistics about the location
(more on that in a minute!).</P>

<P>The Action Bar has 6 options - Start, Info, MIAs, Stats, Options and Quit.</P>

<P>Clicking on Start will allow you play the mission you have currently selected (as Selected Destination).</P>

<P>Info will display information about the destination you have selected. You will be shown how many MIAs you have
rescued in that area and which objectives you have currently completed. This will be useful to you later in the
game when you wish to revisit missions in order to complete them fully. A briefing is available for missions
that have yet to be cleared and an objective summary is available afterwards.</P>

<P>MIAs displays a list of all the MIAs that you have and haven't currently rescued. The list is updated once an
area is cleared. The list shows the MIAs names, locations and their status (Found or Missing). Like the Info
screen this is useful for discovering what levels need to still be rescued. Click in the Left and Right arrows
to scroll through the various pages.</P>

<P>Stats gives you some information on how you are currently doing in the game. Most of the information here is
just for fun. There are three pages, giving various bits of information. One thing to note - You may notice that
the Percentage Complete statistic fluctuates a lot. This is because this is a percentage of what is currently
known and not an overall percentage. So you may notice that at one stage it says 60% and then after finishing
a stage it says 55%!</P>

<A NAME="enemies"></A>
<H4>Enemies</H4>
<P>The aliens are now littered around the Blobs' homeworld. Most of them have taken over the bodies of Blob
soliders and are using them for their evil purposes. Some others travel around in their robot housing. Most
of the enemies are easily dealt with - A single shot will take them down. But what they lack in defence they
make up for in weaponry. Here are just a couple of the enemies you may encounter,</P>

<TABLE CLASS="blue" CELLPADDING="5">

<TABLE>

<P>Other Blobs, ariel and swimming enemies exist. Keep your eyes peeled...</P>

<A NAME="bosses"></A>
<H4>Bosses</H4>
<P>During the course of them game (except Easy) you will encounter Bosses. These are often Blobs that the
aliens have experimented on and transformed into hidious creatures. They are a lot stronger than normal
enemies, attack differently and are all very dangerous. Bob will have to confront each other these bosses
before he can move on. In some cases the boss's base area will also contain a item that essential to 
Bob's progress within the game.</P>

<A NAME="galdov"></A>
<H4>Galdov</H4>
<P><IMG SRC="galdov.png" TITLE="Galdov, the Metal Blob" ALIGN="LEFT">
Galdov is the alien leader. He looks strangely like the Blobs, except for the fact that he is entirely
robotic. He has been dubbed Metal Blob by the Blobs for his appearence seems to harbour a secret to the
Blobs' past, the reason the aliens have attack their world and the myths and legends of "war".
</P>

<P>A particular times in the game you will be required to battle Galdov. He is more powerful than regular
enemies and has more weapons available at his disposal. Don't linger.</P>

<A NAME="weapons"></A>
<H4>Weapons</H4>

<P>There are five different weapons that Bob can get in Blob Wars : Metal Blob Solid,</P>

<TABLE CLASS="blue" CELLPADDING="5">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>Pistol</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="pistolIcon.png" TITLE="Pistol Powerup"></TD>
<TD>This is your standard weapon and the weapon that Bob always begins a mission with. Compared to the other
weapons it seems rather wimpy due to its slow during rate. However it is the <I>only</I> weapon that can be fired
underwater!</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>Machine Gun</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="machineGunIcon.png" TITLE="Machine Gun Powerup"></TD>
<TD>Somewhat the same as the pistol except for the high firing rate. This is a useful mission for clearing
large numbers of enemies quickly.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>Grenades</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="grenadeIcon.png" TITLE="Grenade Powerup"></TD>
<TD>Grenades bounce around and explode on contact. The explosion is enough to take
out a few enemies within a small radius. Although grenades cannot be thrown underwater, it is possible to jump out of
the water and throw a grenade. Careful timing can help to tkae out enemies in the water. The explosion from your own
grenades cannot harm you, so don't worry. Grenades also have other uses, since they can be thrown into places
Bob may not be able to normally access...</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>Laser Cannon</B></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="laserIcon.png" TITLE="Laser Cannon Powerup"></TD>
<TD>Slow to fire but has the devestating effect of passing through the enemy it strikes. A single laser bolt can take

<H4>Aqua Lung and Jetpack</H4>

<P>Two special unique items appear in the game - An Aqua Lung and a Jetpack. These two items are both essential
for progressing further in missions and also for rescuing all the MIAs. Some missions will <I>require</I> you to
have one of these two items so you can play them properly.</P>

<IMG SRC="aquaLung.png" TITLE="Pistol Powerup" ALIGN="LEFT" SPACING="5">
<P>The Aqua Lung provides the player with an unlimited supply of oxygen, so you can stay underwater forever. You
will then be able to reach MIAs and areas that you were previously unable to. There is no need to activate this
item, it is used automatically when you enter water. You will also notice that there is no longer an oxygen meter
at the top of the screen. Note that the Aqua Lung <I>does not</I> protect you from slime and lava.</P>

<IMG SRC="jetpack.gif" TITLE="Pistol Powerup" ALIGN="LEFT">
<P>The Jetpack allows the player to fly for a short time when it is activated. Press Space and then use the
directional buttons to fly in the direction you desire. There are two things to note about the Jetpack - Unlike enemies,
when flying Bob will suffer inertia... that is to say, if you are flying left and then push right you will have to
slow down before you can begin flying right. You can however fly one way and shoot another using this technique. The
second thing to note is that the Jetpack has an energy limit. Whilst it is activated it will lose power. The remaining
power is shown at the top of the screen (in place of oxygen). When the power runs out, the Jetpack will automatically
disengage. The Jetpack recharges whilst it is not in use. Note that the Jetpack cannot be reactivated if it has
less than 3 units of power.</P>

<P>These items will become available as your progress through the game. They are unique so only need to
be found once (so don't panic if you haven't found them, you can't miss them!).</P>

<A NAME="misc"></A>
<H4>Misc Gameplay Information</H4>

<P>As you progress through the game you may notice that some levels have objectives marked as
"???????????". These objectives (at the time) are optional but all will be revealed much later into
the game's story.</P>

<P>There is no need to worry about completing these objectives until you are prompted to by the
game.</P>

<H4>About Parallel Realities</H4>

<P>Parallel Realities started off writing games on the Amiga using AMOS and then, later, Blitz Basic
2. Games written included the BOTSS Trilogy and most notably TANX Squadron. TANX Squadron was awarded
Amiga Format's contributor prize of the month in the summer of 1999. Project: Starfighter was Parallel
Realities' first contribution to the Linux gaming scene and was well recieved when it was released in
2003.</P>

<P>Blob Wars : Metal Blob Solid is our second contribution to Linux and we hope you enjoy it as much
as Project: Starfighter. Like Starfighter the game went through several incarnation before the platform
game was decided on. The original game involved a Capture the Flag type affair whilst the second was
centered on a Blob agent called Solid Blob and his (rather dopey) companion, Bob.</P>

<P>The game direction changed when we wanted something a little faster paced and with more replay
value. The game changed from its top down view point to a platform game and the Evil Blobs became
assimilated Blobs. Bob later became the hero of the game now known as Metal Blob Solid.</P>

<H4>About Perpendicular Dimensions</H4>

<P>After 2011, Parallel Realities stopped maintaining Blob Wars.
It is now maintiained by others under the name Perpendicular Dimensions.
We like to thank Parallel Realities for creating this great game and for releasing it under a FOSS license.
